# As noted above, the main program focuses on reading the input data,
# and printing the output, and defers much of the work of identifying
# observable events to a subroutine.  Here it is!

sub get_eclipses {

  # This subroutine takes as input various parameters that describe
  # one particular target (name, coordinates, magnitude), its
  # ephemeris (zero point, period, depth and time width of transit),
  # and observing circumstances (latitude, longitude, timezone,
  # time/date window to consider).  It then calculates the events
  # occurring during the specified time window for that target, and
  # determines whether or not these will be observable (or partially
  # observable) given the input constraints.  Information about any
  # observable events is returned in the form of references to arrays
  # of event information; see end of subroutine for details on what is
  # returned.  Note: returned array references may be to empty arrays,
  # i.e. there may be no observable events for a particular target.

  # First, unpack the input parameters; these are passed in a hash so
  # that they can be identified by name, i.e. it's not necessary to
  # pass them in in any particular order.

# by specifying whether to search forward or backward in 
# time from a specified starting point.  

# Note that this search is not foolproof.  It assumes that you are
# passing in the time of an event that is observable with the input
# constraints, and the question is only how far past that (in either
# direction) you can also observe. 

# The speed of the search can be increased by using coarser time
# steps, at the expense of precision of the time constraint
# returned. The time returned will always be observable, but for, say,
# a 10-minute time step it could be conservative by up to just shy of
# 10 minutes. It is only used for the hour angle constraint, not the
# daytime or elevation constraints. 

# Inputs:  Hash ref of input parameters:
#   max_baseline: baseline to try, in hours
#   start_time: DateTime object giving zero point for search, *not 
#      including baseline*.  (Typically ingress or egress time.)  So
#      we shift this by max_baseline to start the search. 
#   backward: if this flag is true, search back in time.
#   time_step_minutes:  Step size for hour angle search; others can be 
#      calculated directly. 
#   target, sun:  Astro::Coords instances for those bodies, containing
#      info about their coords, observing location, and time. 
#   twilight_rad:  Solar elevation in radians defining twilight. 
#   minimum_elevation:  elevation in degrees above which target is
#      considered observable. 
#   alt_min_elevation:  As above, but alternate elevation to search if
#     target never gets above minimum_elevation.  This is only relevant
#     when finding start and stop times for targets with asymmetric
#     limits.  During transit, either limit could apply. 
#   max_time: DateTime object, time beyond which returned time should
#     not extend.  This is used to keep pre-ingress limits from bleeding
#     over and returning post-ingress start times in the unequal limit
#     case.  If 'backward' is true, this is an *earliest* time limit.
#   minimum_ha, maximum_ha:  hour angle limits, in hours. 
#   name:  Target name - only used for informative error messages.
