# Script to create finding charts by grabbing DSS images.
# Reads an input file, constructs a URL from the coordinates, fetches
# the image from the DSS server, and saves the image.  Optionally, it
# can resolve an object name via Simbad and get the coordinates that
# way.  Can be run from the command-line, or called by the web
# interface create_finding_charts.cgi.

# If you need a version of ImageMagick for Mac OSX, you can get it
# from the main ImageMagick site, or there is an easy-to-use installer
# at https://cactuslab.com/imagemagick/.
#   
# Also requires the Perl packages LWP::Simple and Getopt::Long, but I
# believe that those are part of the standard distribution for most if
# not all Perl installations.

#
# Usage:   get_finding_charts.pl inputfile
#     Alternatively, it can read coords from standard input, e.g.
#          grep "HD" my_coord_file | get_finding_charts.pl
#     to only make a finding chart for stars in your list with HD
#     names. 
# It can also resolve names, so you could also do
#          echo "T Tau" | get_finding_charts.pl
# to have it resolve the name "T Tau" into coordinates, and then make
# a finding chart with default parameters. 

# Expected format for input text file; columns should be separated by
# commas or ",." (comma plus period).
# Column 0:    object name; just used to name the output file
#              and label the image.
# Column 1: RA in h:m:s (J2000), colon-separated
# Column 2: Dec in d:m:s (J2000), colon-separated
# -or-
# Just a Simbad-resolvable object name, one per line.  The script
# tries to figure out what kind of input each line is; if there are
# fewer than three comma-separated fields on a given line, it tries to
# interpret that whole line as an object name and resolve it with
# Simbad.

# Command-line options are explained in the 'usage' subroutine just
# below.  For most of these, you can change the defaults below in the
# script.

    print STDERR << "END_OF_HELP";

Usage: $program coordfile
   or: echo \"Star name\" | $program

where 'coordfile' is a text file of comma-separated fields, with 
field 1 being the object name, field 2 the RA, and field 3 the Declination.
Coordinates are assumed J2000, in sexagesimal, colon-separated format.
Example input line:

GG Tau , 04:32:30.34 ,  +17:31:40.6

Text after these three fields is ignored.

Options:

 --coordinates: Resolve name to coords only, no finding chart.
 --height: Field height (N-S) in arcminutes.
 --width:  Field width (E-W) in arcminutes.
 --directory: Directory for output.
 --hardlink-from-dir: Check to see if the chart already exists in the
                      specified directory, and if so, hardlink to 
                      that file rather than creating a new one.
 --suffix: Suffix for output image; if recognized by ImageMagick, it
     sets the image type, i.e. you can use
          "--suffix .png" to get a PNG output image; but 
          "--suffix .foo" will give an error since it doesn\'t know
          how to convert to image format "foo".
 --stdout: Write image data to standard output, not to a file. 
 --detector-width: Show outline of CCD detector on chart, with
                   specified width in arcmin.  If no height is
                   given, defaults to same as width.
 --detector-height: Show outline of CCD detector on chart, with
                    specified width in arcmin.
 --guider: Show outline of guider chip on chart.
 --invert: Black stars on a white sky.
 --force: Overwrite pre-existing output file of the same name.
 --verbose: More verbose output about what is happening.
 --quiet: Don\'t print any status messages.
 --sleep: Sleep the specified number of seconds between successive
          finding charts; useful if you don\'t want to overtax an 
	  image server with rapid-fire queries, and don\'t care 
	  much about how long it takes you to make a bunch of charts.
 --skip: Number of lines to skip at the beginning of the input. Useful 
         if your input file has headers that aren\'t commented out.
 --help: Print this help.
